                        But too often, that process comes at the expense of privacy, trust, and user experience.
                        Companies collect vast amounts of personal data, not always to protect users but to fuel
                        business models that put profit first. In some regions, this data is even misused by authorities
                        to restrict freedoms and limit opportunity.</p>}
